Primary key is id_store
or id_order Foreign key is id_table,
id_waiter,
id_device

•	There is no duplicates in all columns
•	There is differences in the count of columns and count of nulls in(id_table, id_waiter,id_device,dim_source)
•	M_cached_payed has 263462 negative number
•	M_cached_price has 263461 negative number
•	dim_source has upper and lower case letters
•	date_opened and closed we can separate it to date and time and remove utc
•	we saw a time differance in minutes that is high for example 35 hours we can remove the customer time > 6 hours
